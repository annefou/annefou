### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Research Software Engineer working for the [Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (NeIC)](https://neic.no/). 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - [CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org/) project: it aims at promoting Best Software Practices
  - [NICEST2](https://neic.no/nicest2/) project: it is the second phase of the Nordic Collaboration on e-Infrastructures for Earth System Modeling focuses on strengthening the Nordic position within climate modeling by leveraging, reinforcing and complementing ongoing initiatives.
  - [EOSC-Nordic](https://www.eosc-nordic.eu/) project: it aims to facilitate the coordination of EOSC relevant initiatives within the Nordic and Baltic countries. I am involved in the WP5 on the [climate Science demonstrator](https://nordicesmhub.github.io/eosc-nordic-climate-demonstrator/).


- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the [Nordic Earth System Modelling Hub](https://github.com/NordicESMhub/) and/or the [Galaxy Climate Science Workbench](https://climate.usegalaxy.eu/)
